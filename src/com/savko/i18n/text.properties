text.about=As one of the most iconic hostels, The Royal Hostel is quite simply the place to be in London. Whether you \
  are staying in one of the exquisite rooms, unwinding in the spa, enjoying homemade food, you will experience the epitome of timeless peace. The Royal Hostel, which is superbly \
  located in the centre of London and overlooks both Hyde Park and Mayfair, is a favourite choice of each traveler. \
  Spacious, pleasant, each room features specially commissioned fabrics, cushioned furniture and exceedingly \
  comfortable beds, while our white marble bathrooms are said to feature the deepest baths in London. Enjoy the finest \
  pastries with your afternoon tea at The Promenade, visit the hotspot that is China Tang or The Grill.
