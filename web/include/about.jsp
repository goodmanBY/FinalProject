        Michelin-starred cuisine or indulging in an award-winning afternoon tea, you will experience the epitome of
        timeless glamour. The Dorchester, which is superbly located in the centre of London and overlooks both Hyde
        Park and Mayfair, is a favourite choice of celebrities, world leaders, royalty and high society.Spacious,
        luxurious and elegant, each room features specially commissioned fabrics, antique furniture and exceedingly
        comfortable beds, while our white marble bathrooms are said to feature the deepest baths in London. Alain
        Ducasse at The Dorchester is the only UK hotel restaurant with three Michelin-stars, putting its creative
        French cuisine firmly in London’s culinary spotlight. Enjoy the finest pastries with your afternoon tea at

        designed oasis, indulge in signature spa treatments such as a Carol Joy London facial and an Aromatherapy
